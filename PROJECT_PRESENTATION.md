# AI Product Categorizer - Project Presentation & Overview

> **This document is designed for use in presentations. It provides a comprehensive, clear, and structured overview of the project for both technical and non-technical audiences.**

---

## 1. Project Purpose & Vision

AI Product Categorizer is a full-stack web application that enables users to upload product images and automatically categorize them using artificial intelligence. The platform supports user authentication, personalized product management, and an admin panel for user oversight.

**Key Goals:**
- Simplify product listing and categorization for end-users
- Ensure secure, user-specific data management
- Provide a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface

---

## 2. System Architecture

**Frontend:** React + Chakra UI
- Handles user interface, authentication, product upload, and admin dashboard

**Backend:** Flask (Python) + PyTorch (CLIP)
- Manages API endpoints, user authentication, product storage, and AI-based image analysis

**Database:** SQLite
- Stores user and product data securely

**AI Model:** OpenAI CLIP (runs locally)
- Analyzes uploaded images and suggests product categories

**Diagram (Textual):**
```
[User] ⇄ [React Frontend] ⇄ [Flask API] ⇄ [SQLite DB]
                                 │
                                 └── [CLIP AI Model]
```

## 4. Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React
- Chakra UI
- Axios
- React Router DOM

**Backend:**
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- PyTorch, transformers, CLIP
- Pillow, numpy
- SQLite
- PyJWT, bcrypt

---

## 5. User Flows

### a) Registration & Login
- User registers with email and password
- Receives JWT on login; session managed securely

### b) Product Upload & Categorization
- User uploads or takes a photo
- AI model analyzes and suggests categories
- User selects and confirms category
- Product is saved and visible only to the user

### c) Product Management
- Users see only their own products
- Can delete their own products
- Profile page allows updating personal info

### d) Admin Panel
- Only admins can access
- View all users and their details

---

## 6. Security & Data Integrity
- All passwords are hashed (bcrypt)
- JWT required for all protected endpoints
- Product actions are user-specific (user_id checks)
- CORS configured for safe frontend-backend communication
- File uploads validated for type and extension

---

## 7. Unique & Notable Aspects
- **AI Integration:** Local CLIP model for fast, private image analysis
- **Camera Support:** Users can take photos directly from device
- **User Isolation:** Each user's data is private and secure
- **Admin Controls:** Role-based access for platform management
- **Modern UI:** Chakra UI for accessibility and responsiveness

---

## 8. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive manual and automated tests for all features
- Bug fixes and validation steps documented in `TEST_2.md`
- Codebase cleaned, documented, and ready for handover

---

## 9. Summary

AI Product Categorizer demonstrates a robust, secure, and user-friendly approach to AI-powered product management. The project is suitable for both technical demonstration and real-world deployment.
