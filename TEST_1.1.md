# Test 1.1: Automatic Cleanup of Unclassified Product Photos

This document summarizes the latest update made in addition to the main cleanup and test process described in Test 1.

---

## Problem Identification
- During code and file structure review, it was manually detected that photos of products without a category and not listed were accumulating in the `backend/uploads` folder.
- These photos were not visible in the frontend or backend API but were unnecessarily occupying disk space.

---

## Update Implemented
- In the backend, the code was updated so that photos of products without a category are automatically deleted immediately after analysis during upload.
- Now, only photos of products that have a category and are saved to the database remain in the uploads folder.
- For products without a category, both an error message is returned to the user and unnecessary file accumulation is prevented.

---

## Test and Result
- Old unnecessary photos were manually deleted.
- In the new system, photos of products without a category are automatically deleted and do not occupy space in the backend folder.
- Tests were successful, and this part of the system is now completely clean and sustainable.
