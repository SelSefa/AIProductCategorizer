# Test 1: Comprehensive Code Cleanup and Functional Test Report

This file summarizes the comprehensive code cleanup, dependency management, functional tests, and actions taken in the project. It can be used as a reference in project presentations.

---

## 1. Initial Checkpoint
- The current, working, and tested state of the code was saved as a git branch: `checkpoint/temizlik-oncesi`
- New checkpoints were created at every critical step (e.g., `checkpoint/eslint-oncesi`)

---

## 2. Code Cleanup and Dependency Management
- **Unused imports, functions, and variables were removed from frontend and backend files.**
- **Unnecessary dependencies were removed from `backend/requirements.txt`:**
  - Removed: `psycopg2-binary`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `openai`, `python-multipart`
  - Kept: `Flask`, `Flask-CORS`, `gunicorn`, `Pillow`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `clip`
- **Technologies used** and their purposes were summarized in separate files: `backend/USED_TECHNOLOGIES.md`, `frontend/USED_TECHNOLOGIES.md`

---

## 3. Functional Tests
- **Backend and frontend were started, and core features were tested:**
  - Product upload and analysis
  - Product listing
  - Categorization
- **CORS and security tests:**
  - CORS headers were checked in the browser's Network panel
  - Screenshots were taken showing correct headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
- **API tests:**
  - JSON data was retrieved from http://localhost:8000/api/products
  - Communication between frontend and backend was verified

---

## 4. ESLint and Linter Warnings
- **ESLint warnings were resolved:**
  - Functions used inside `useEffect` were added to the dependency array
  - The `fetchProducts` function was wrapped with `useCallback`
- **If a runtime error occurred, the code was reverted to the last checkpoint**

---

## 5. Screenshots and Test Evidence
- Screenshots taken during the test process:
  - Interfaces showing successful operation of frontend and backend
  - Network panel showing correct CORS headers
  - Example JSON data returned from the API
  - Error and warning screens (e.g., runtime error, ESLint warning)

---

## 6. Conclusion and Evaluation
- Code functionality and cleanliness were ensured
- All critical steps and changes were recorded with checkpoints
- The project was brought up to modern React and Python standards
- Summaries and reports necessary for presentation and documentation were prepared

---

## Explanations and Notes
- All changes, decisions, and encountered issues at each step were explained in detail
- Safe points were created for quick rollback in case of code breakage
- All screenshots and logs taken during tests were archived (you can show visuals separately in the presentation)
