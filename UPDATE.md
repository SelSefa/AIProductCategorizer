## 4. Product Management & AI Categorization

### PRODUCT UPLOAD & ANALYSIS
- **Description:** Users can upload product images, which are analyzed and categorized by AI.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Frontend:** File/camera upload, preview, category selection modal.

- **Implementation:**
  - **Frontend:** `/products` route, product grid, delete button.
  - **Backend:** `/api/products` (GET), `/api/products/<id>` (DELETE) endpoints. Delete checks user_id ownership.

### PRODUCT DELETION SECURITY

## Feature Interrelations
- **JWT** is the backbone for all authentication, authorization, and user isolation.
- **User-product isolation** is enforced both in backend queries and frontend filtering.
- **Admin panel** is only accessible if JWT role is `admin`.
- **Profile editing** is only allowed for the logged-in user (self-update).
- **All product actions** (upload, list, delete) are scoped to the authenticated user.
- **UI/UX improvements** are applied globally for a consistent experience.
